* TI-84 PCE Basic (6/10)
* C++ (3/10)

### Cool projects I'm actually proud of

* [AOS](https://github.com/Nanobot567/AOS-2), a terminal-based OS
* [potatoscript](https://github.com/Nanobot567/potscr), an esoteric programming language
* [nanoscrape](https://github.com/Nanobot567/nanoscript), a tiny web scraper
* [cleanup.bat](https://github.com/Nanobot567/cleanup.bat), an annoying virus to get back at my enemies
